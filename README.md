# MIPS
My cute little mips javascript processor. this is disgusting and was made in 2 weeks.


# What it does
So this program is an entirely in-browser MIPS compiler and emulator that can read, write, and execute MIPS assembly and bytecode. The functionality is all there and at the moment it is executing TORTURE.ASM which is a torture test from DALE university. The current execution can be run [here](https://raidandfade.github.io/MIPS/)
